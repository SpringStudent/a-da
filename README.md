#### a-da (ā dà) is translated as "阿大", named after a term my son likes. It is an open-source remote desktop control system.

Built on javacv + netty + swing technology, it ensures stable frame rates through streaming media transmission. Currently,
it only supports the Windows operating system. If you need support for other operating systems, you can check out another 
open-source project of mine:https://github.com/SpringStudent/remote-desktop-control
